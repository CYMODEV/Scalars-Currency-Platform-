# Scalars-Currency-Platform-
Scalars.app is designed as a hub for all applications and ecosystems where quantifiable magnitude is the core unit of value.
# SCALAR – Public Declaration of Use as a Coin or Token

## 1. Purpose of This Declaration
This document serves as an official public disclosure of the intended use, scope, and governance of **SCALAR**, the base unit of magnitude within the [Scalars.app](https://scalars.app) ecosystem.  
It is published to establish transparency, timestamp authorship, and provide clarity to contributors, partners, and users.

---

## 2. Nature of SCALAR
- **Type:** Digital asset deployed on a public blockchain as either:
  - **Token** – ERC‑20 or equivalent standard on an existing chain, or
  - **Coin** – Native asset on a dedicated blockchain network.
- **Function:** Serves as the **universal settlement and measurement unit** for all magnitude‑based applications registered in the Scalars.app Magnitude Registry.
- **Symbol:** `SCALAR`
- **Decimals:** 18 (unless otherwise specified for a given deployment)
- **Utility:**  
  - Settlement of transactions between magnitude‑specific tokens (ASMTs)  
  - Liquidity pairing for application‑specific markets  
  - Governance staking and voting within the Scalars DAO  
  - Unit of account for cross‑application magnitude comparisons

## 3. Intended Use
SCALAR is designed **solely as a utility token** within the Scalars.app ecosystem.  
It is **not** intended to represent equity, securities, debt instruments, or any form of investment contract.  
Its primary roles include:
1. **Measurement:** Acting as a base unit for quantifying scalar values (energy, time, mass, dosage, etc.).
2. **Settlement:** Enabling instant swaps between application‑specific magnitude tokens.
3. **Governance:** Allowing holders to participate in magnitude standard approvals and platform upgrades.
4. **Incentives:** Rewarding creators, validators, and contributors for ecosystem growth.

- **Name & Symbol:** “SCALAR” and “Scalars.app” are trademarks of the project steward(s).
- **Codebase:** Unless otherwise stated, SCALAR smart contracts and related code are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
- **Magnitude Registry:** Definitions and metadata are stored on‑chain and are publicly queryable.

---

## 5. Governance & Control
- **Initial Custody:** Managed by a multisignature treasury until DAO governance is fully operational.
- **DAO Transition:** Control over minting, burning, and protocol parameters will transition to the Scalars DAO.
- **Transparency:** All governance proposals, votes, and treasury transactions will be publicly viewable on‑chain.

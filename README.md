# Scalars-Currency-Platform-
Scalars.app is designed as a hub for all applications and ecosystems where quantifiable magnitude is the core unit of value.
# SCALAR – Public Declaration of Use as a Coin or Token

## 1. Purpose of This Declaration
This document serves as an official public disclosure of the intended use, scope, and governance of **SCALAR**, the base unit of magnitude within the [Scalars.app](https://scalars.app) ecosystem.  
It is published to establish transparency, timestamp authorship, and provide clarity to contributors, partners, and users.

---

## 2. Nature of SCALAR
- **Type:** Digital asset deployed on a public blockchain as either:
  - **Token** – ERC‑20 or equivalent standard on an existing chain, or
  - **Coin** – Native asset on a dedicated blockchain network.
- **Function:** Serves as the **universal settlement and measurement unit** for all magnitude‑based applications registered in the Scalars.app Magnitude Registry.
- **Symbol:** `SCALAR`
- **Decimals:** 18 (unless otherwise specified for a given deployment)
- **Utility:**  
  - Settlement of transactions between magnitude‑specific tokens (ASMTs)  
  - Liquidity pairing for application‑specific markets  
  - Governance staking and voting within the Scalars DAO  
  - Unit of account for cross‑application magnitude comparisons

---

## 3. Intended Use
SCALAR is designed **solely as a utility token** within the Scalars.app ecosystem.  
It is **not** intended to represent equity, securities, debt instruments, or any form of investment contract.  
Its primary roles include:
1. **Measurement:** Acting as a base unit for quantifying scalar values (energy, time, mass, dosage, etc.).
2. **Settlement:** Enabling instant swaps between application‑specific magnitude tokens.
3. **Governance:** Allowing holders to participate in magnitude standard approvals and platform upgrades.
4. **Incentives:** Rewarding creators, validators, and contributors for ecosystem growth.

---

## 4. Intellectual Property & Branding
- **Name & Symbol:** “SCALAR” and “Scalars.app” are trademarks of the project steward(s).
- **Codebase:** Unless otherwise stated, SCALAR smart contracts and related code are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
- **Magnitude Registry:** Definitions and metadata are stored on‑chain and are publicly queryable.

---

## 5. Governance & Control
- **Initial Custody:** Managed by a multisignature treasury until DAO governance is fully operational.
- **DAO Transition:** Control over minting, burning, and protocol parameters will transition to the Scalars DAO.
- **Transparency:** All governance proposals, votes, and treasury transactions will be publicly viewable on‑chain.

---

## 6. Disclaimers
- SCALAR is a **functional utility token** and should not be acquired for speculative purposes.
- The project team does not guarantee any market value, price appreciation, or liquidity.
- Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws in their jurisdiction.

---

## 7. Contact & Verification
- **Website:** [https://scalars.app](https://scalars.app)
- **Registry:** SCALAR contract address and metadata will be published and verified on the relevant blockchain explorer.
- **Inquiries:** For technical or governance questions, open an issue in this repository or contact the project maintainers.

*This declaration is effective as of the date of its first commit to this repository and may be updated as the project evolves.*
# SCALAR Token Specification Sheet

## 1. Overview
- **Name:** SCALAR Token
- **Symbol:** SCALAR
- **Type:** Utility token (ERC‑20 or equivalent standard)
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Primary Role:** Universal settlement and measurement unit for all magnitude‑based applications in the Scalars.app ecosystem.
- **Status:** Deployed / Pending Deployment (update with actual status)
- **Official Website:** [https://scalars.app](https://scalars.app)

---

## 2. Contract Details
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Contract Address** | `0x...` (to be updated after deployment) |
| **Blockchain Network** | e.g., Ethereum Mainnet / Polygon / Base |
| **Token Standard** | ERC‑20 + EIP‑2612 Permit |
| **Initial Supply** | 300,000,000 SCALAR |
| **Max Supply** | Fixed at initial supply unless DAO vote approves change |
| **Minting Authority** | Multisig treasury until DAO governance is live |
| **Burn Functionality** | Enabled |
| **Pause Functionality** | Enabled for security/emergency use |

---

## 3. Utility & Use Cases
- **Settlement Layer:** Base unit for swaps between application‑specific magnitude tokens (ASMTs).
- **Measurement Standard:** Anchors all magnitude definitions in the on‑chain Magnitude Registry.
- **Governance:** Staking and voting in the Scalars DAO for magnitude approvals, upgrades, and treasury allocation.
- **Liquidity Pairing:** Default pairing asset for ASMT liquidity pools.
- **Incentives:** Rewards for creators, validators, and ecosystem contributors.

---

## 4. Governance Parameters
- **Initial Governance:** Controlled by a 3‑of‑5 multisig (Safe) with roles for minting, pausing, and parameter changes.
- **DAO Transition:** Governance rights migrate to the Scalars DAO after decentralization milestone.
- **Proposal Process:** On‑chain proposals with quorum and majority thresholds (to be defined in DAO constitution).
- **Treasury Management:** Transparent on‑chain treasury with public reporting.

---

## 5. Security & Compliance
- **Audit Status:** (Insert audit firm name and date once complete)
- **Bug Bounty:** Planned via reputable platform (e.g., Immunefi)
- **Compliance Statement:** SCALAR is a functional utility token, not a security or investment contract. Users are responsible for legal compliance in their jurisdiction.

## 6. Metadata & Branding
- **Logo:** (link to SVG/PNG in repo)
- **Token Lists:** Submitted to major token list registries (Uniswap, Trust Wallet, etc.)
- **Explorer Verification:** Contract verified on relevant block explorer.
